# senior-project-malware-research

Implementation of the code in this repository relies on a variety of different software and operating system services.

The code is developed and compiled in the Kali Linux 3 (2021) Virtual Machine but can be adjusted to run on other operating systems. It is specifically designed for a simulated attack on a device (or VM) running Windows 7 or Windows 10 and will not operate in the same manner for a different OS. 

Compilation of the code to produce the executable file to run on target machine requires installation of Mingw-w64 (a free software development environment and compiler system used to create applications/code to run on Windows Systems). 

Different systems outside of Kali Linux will require variations of the following commands used to compile code within the terminal:

1. Mingw-w64 installation - "sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-i686" (If this command is unsuccessful, the Mingw downloads page may be of help: https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)


2. Compilation of the server connection program to create server file - "gcc bds-connection.c -o bds-connection" (This command should be executed in the same location as the connection file)


3. Compilation of malware backdoor code to create executable deliverable file that would then be used to carry out a would-be infection - "i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o mal.exe windows7-bds.c -lwsock32 -lwininet" ("mal.exe" can be replaced by whatever name is to be assigned to the executable file)
