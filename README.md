# Michael Peters  -  senior-project-malware-under-the-hood

This GitHub repository contains all associated materials for my senior capstone project for which I performed an in-depth examination of the subject of malware. After conducting thorough research, I was able to implement my own malware, which I then used to simulate a real-world attack on one of my own personal devices. For a comprehensive description of this project, please see the file entitled MUTH Final Research Report.

Note: Program functions within this repository are not fully original. Certain portions of code were generated while coding along with the ethical hacking online course referenced above. Customization has occurred to suit project research goals and execution of my personal unique attack scenario. The main purpose of this project is to examine and understand malware beneath the surface so that we (my audience and I) may better combat the growing threat that it presents. The purpose is not to gain the ability to create wholly unprecedented malware that can be used with malicious intent. The project report includes dissection and analysis of various functions shown in this repository. If the following instructions for implementation are seen as lacking, see the project report for a more extensive walkthrough of the execution process. 

Successful implementation of the code in this repository relies on a variety of different software and operating system services.

In my case, the code was developed and compiled in a Kali Linux 3 (2021) Virtual Machine but it can be adjusted to run on certain other operating systems. The executable produced from the attacking machine is specifically designed for a simulated attack on a device (or VM) running Windows 7 or Windows 10 and will not operate for a different OS. 

Compilation of the code to produce the executable file to run on the target machine requires installation of Mingw-w64 (a free software development environment and compiler system used to create applications/code to run on Windows Systems). 

Different systems outside of Kali Linux will require variations of the following commands used to compile code within the terminal/command prompt:

1. Mingw-w64 installation - "sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-i686" (If this command is unsuccessful, the Mingw downloads page may be of help: https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)


2. Compilation of the server connection program to create the server file - "gcc bds-connection.c -o bds-connection" (This command should be executed in the same location/directory as the connection file)


3. Compilation of malware backdoor code to create the executable deliverable file that would then be used to carry out a would-be infection - "i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o mal.exe windows7-bds.c -lwsock32 -lwininet" ("mal.exe" can be replaced by whatever name is to be assigned to the executable file)
